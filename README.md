ToyStore
Project Overview: ToyStore is an online toy store management system designed to handle various operations such as product listing, customer management, inventory management, and order processing. The application provides a user-friendly interface for customers to browse and purchase toys, while also allowing the store administrators to manage products, view orders, and track inventory.

Technologies Used:

JDBC (Java Database Connectivity): This project uses JDBC to facilitate communication between the Java application and a relational database. It allows for performing operations such as querying, inserting, updating, and deleting records from the database to manage the store's inventory, customer data, and order information.

Database: A relational database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) is used to store the toy inventory, customer details, and transaction records.

Java: The core backend logic is written in Java, ensuring scalability and maintainability of the application.

Key Features:

Toy Catalog: Display a list of toys available for purchase with details such as price, description, and stock.
Customer Management: Register, login, and manage customer details for order processing and personalized experience.
Order Processing: Users can add toys to the cart and place orders, with integration for order tracking.
Inventory Management: Admins can add, update, and delete toys in the inventory and track stock levels.
SQL Operations: Efficient querying, data retrieval, and management of toy, customer, and order data via JDBC.
